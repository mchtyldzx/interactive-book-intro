# 3D Interactive Book Intro Animation

This is a portfolio showcase project demonstrating web animation techniques. It features a vintage-style book floating in 3D space with cinematic lighting, interactive parallax effects, and smooth GSAP transitions.

## Features

- Procedurally generated 3D book model
- Interactive mouse parallax effects
- Dynamic golden lighting system
- Smooth GSAP animations
- Floating particle system
- Mobile touch support


## How It Works

The book is built entirely with Three.js geometry - no external 3D models. It uses:
- PBR materials for realistic lighting
- Multiple point lights for cinematic atmosphere
- GSAP for smooth entrance and exit animations
- RequestAnimationFrame for 60fps performance
- Mouse tracking for parallax rotation



## Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/mchtyldzx/interactive-book-intro.git
